      <description>Before my Computational Biology course at the University of Texas, I had never used python before. The only type of coding I was familiar with was R, since I had used it in my Biostatistics course from a few years prior. While personally I prefer using R, I can see why people prefer using python as it is able to do many interesting things. There are also ways that R and python can work together and/or do some of the same things.</description>
