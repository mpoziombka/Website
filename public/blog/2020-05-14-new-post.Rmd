Before my Computational Biology course at the University of Texas, I had never used python before. The only type of coding I was familiar with was R, since I had used it in my Biostatistics course from a few years prior. While personally I prefer using R, I can see why people prefer using python as it is able to do many interesting things. There are also ways that R and python can work together and/or do some of the same things. 

Here are some examples of simple, but cool things you can do with python: 


#Character counts
```{python}
sentence = "There are a lot of cool things that can be done in python!"

counts = {}
for c in sentence:
  if c in counts:
    counts[c]+=1
  else:
    counts[c]=1
    
for c in counts:
  print(c, "appears", counts[c], "times")
```


#Subsitution with replacement
```{python}
import re

string = "python is so easy"

re.sub(r"python.* is", "r is", string)

re.sub(r"is", "isn't", string)
```


#R and python interacting
```{r}
library(reticulate)

fi <- "Final"
```

```{python}
fi="project"
print(r.fi,fi)
```

```{r}
cat(c(fi,py$fi))
```
